# Kaggle---Housing-Price-Prediction

## Overview
This GitHub repository contains the project for the Kaggle competition on predicting housing prices in California. The project aims to build a robust model to predict median house values across various districts in California using a comprehensive dataset provided by Kaggle using NeuralNetwork.

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to utilize advanced regression techniques to predict the median housing prices in California. The dataset includes various metrics such as median income, house age, average rooms, average bedrooms, population, average occupancy, latitude, and longitude of the district.

## Features of the Project
- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset undergoes thorough cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, normalize data, and prepare it for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering**: Key features are engineered to improve model performance, including transformations and combinations of existing variables.
- **Model Building**: Several regression models are explored, including Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, and Gradient Boosting among others. The models are trained to learn from the data and predict the median housing price.
- **Model Evaluation**: The models are evaluated based on their Mean Squared Error (MSE) to ensure accuracy and reliability in prediction.
- **Visualization**: Regression charts and other visualizations are provided to illustrate the relationships within the data and the performance of the models.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data analysis and model building.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Utilized for creating regression models and handling typical machine learning workflows.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical calculations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **TensorFlow: For neural networks
